# SpotiPy-Wrapped
This is a notebook I made as a personal project to make sense of the data obtained when requesting personal data from Spotify.  

To get your own personal data go to spotify.com -> account -> privacy -> request data  

If you want to use my script, unzip your data folder into the input folder and follow the instructions in teh notebook  

Instructions for live logging capabilities and using the React app will be added soon  

## Dependencies  
- pandas
- orjson
- spotipy (required for live logger)
